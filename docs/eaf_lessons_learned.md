# EAF Old Repository - Lessons Learned Report
**Comprehensive Analysis of Why the Project Failed**

## Executive Summary

The old EAF project (2025-09 to 2025-10) accumulated ~49 stories across 9 epics with extensive planning infrastructure but ultimately failed due to **over-planning paralysis and loss of focus on the MVP**. The project exemplifies the "verzettelt" (scattered/distracted) problem: detailed documentation and comprehensive risk assessments created the illusion of progress while the actual working system stalled.

**Key Finding**: The team invested heavily in documenting what could go wrong but insufficient focus on delivering what should go right.

---

## Part 1: What Went Wrong

### 1.1 The Planning Trap: Excessive Documentation Created False Confidence

**Pattern Identified**: The old repo contains:
- 49 story files (1,400+ KB of documentation)
- 170+ QA assessment files (risk, NFR, test design, traceability documents)
- Comprehensive Epic 1-9 planning with revision histories
- Detailed architecture specifications (15+ docs)
- Test scenarios with "Given-When-Then" format

**The Problem**: 
This extensive documentation became a proxy for progress. The team was documenting stories 7.4a/7.4b with 90KB of artifacts while the actual framework component couldn't compile. Story 7.4 handoff document from 2025-10-03 explicitly shows CONCERNS gates (70/100 and 75/100 scores) but the team was still approving implementation while the foundation was shaky.

**Evidence**:
```
Timeline analysis of story status files:
- 2025-09-14 to 2025-09-30: 16 stories completed (average quality score 85/100)
- 2025-10-01 to 2025-10-06: 8 stories with recurring issues and high-risk assessments
- 2025-10-07 to 2025-10-15: Stories becoming increasingly interdependent with blocked dependencies
- 2025-10-16 onwards: Stories either deferred or reworking previous stories
```

**Why This Matters**: The team created such detailed assessment documents that stakeholders believed risks were under control. In reality, high-risk stories (score 6 = Medium-High) were being approved with "CONCERNS" gates instead of addressing the fundamental issues.

### 1.2 Architectural Decisions Created Expanding Scope

**Pattern**: The initial 9 epics had cascading dependencies:
- Epic 1-7: Foundation building (months of effort)
- Epic 8: Code Quality & Architectural Alignment (fixing issues that Epic 1-7 should have prevented)
- Epic 9: MVP validation (but the foundation isn't ready)

**Evidence from Git History**:
```
Story 8.3: "Migrate Read Projections from JPA to jOOQ"
- Marked as architectural violation discovered during Epic 8
- Root cause: Epic 2 (Walking Skeleton) used JPA for "rapid prototyping"
- Status note: "jOOQ migration was deferred as technical debt"

Impact: This forced rework of Epic 2's core logic 6 weeks into the project.
```

**The Real Issue**: 
The architecture was sound (Hexagonal/CQRS/ES pattern), but the planning approach tried to implement *everything* at once:
- Story 3.3: 42KB "10-Layer JWT Validation Standard" - comprehensive but overwhelming
- Story 4.1-4.5: 6 stories for multi-tenancy 3-layer enforcement
- Story 6.1-6.6: 6 stories for Flowable BPMN integration (later became deferred for post-MVP)
- Story 7.1-7.4: 4 stories for scaffolding CLI (consuming weeks while core wasn't stable)

### 1.3 Loss of Focus on MVP Definition

**Critical Finding**: The original goals were clear:
> "Build the first complete internal application (the Licensing Server) *using only* the EAF components from Epics 1-8, validating all MVP Success Criteria."

But Epic 9 never happened properly because Epics 1-8 weren't production-ready.

**Evidence from QA Assessments**:
```
Story 9.1: "Implement React-Admin Consumer Application"
- Completed on 2025-10-15
- Status: "Frontend integration 100% functional but CRUD blocked by backend QueryHandler ExecutionException"
- Root cause: TenantDatabaseSessionInterceptor used wrong database connection type

Story 9.2: "Fix widget-demo QueryHandler ExecutionException"
- This should have been caught in Story 4.4 (Tenant Context Propagation)
- Instead it was discovered during MVP validation (after 10+ stories completed)
```

**The Pattern**:
Each epic was "complete" by documentation standards but had foundational issues that cascaded:
1. Story 4.4 (tenant context propagation) - appeared complete
2. Story 8.3 (jOOQ migration) - discovered that JPA was wrong choice in Epic 2
3. Story 9.2 (fix QueryHandler) - discovered tenant interceptor was using wrong connection
4. Story 9.3 (fix interceptor pointcut) - discovered AspectJ wasn't matching correctly

### 1.4 Recurring High-Risk Patterns Ignored

**Pattern Across Stories**: QA assessments consistently identified risks that were acknowledged but not resolved:

**Story 1.1 (Foundation)**:
- Risk BUS-001: "Foundation blocking development" (Score 6 - HIGH)
- Risk TECH-001: "Convention plugin misconfiguration" (Score 6 - HIGH)
- Mitigation: "Implement incremental verification strategy"
- What happened: 49 stories later, basic tenant context still broken

**Story 7.4a (Framework Shell)**:
- Risk TECH-001: "Architectural dependency on Story 7.4a"
- Risk SEC-001: "Path traversal attacks"  
- Recommendation: "PROCEED with security focus"
- What happened: Story 7.4a reached v1.2 approval but was never fully implemented (frontend never built)

**Story 8.2 (Pre-Commit Hooks)**:
- "Establish Pre-Commit Hook Infrastructure"
- Assessment: 88/100, "APPROVED with minor optimizations"
- Implementation status: "DONE" on 2025-10-05
- But backend was still broken (stories 9.1-9.3)

**The Meta-Problem**: The QA assessment process became a checkbox exercise. Stories could get "CONCERNS - ACCEPTED" gates with high risks, and the team would proceed. No mechanism existed to enforce resolution.

### 1.5 Technology Choices Were Sound But Overwhelming

**Not a Tech Problem**:
- Kotlin/JVM/Spring Modulith ✅ Correct choice
- PostgreSQL + Axon + CQRS/ES ✅ Correct pattern
- Keycloak OIDC ✅ Right for security
- jOOQ for projections ✅ Right for performance

**The Real Problem**: 
The *depth of engineering standards* was correct but the *breadth of scope* was crushing:

```
Story 3.3: 10-Layer JWT Validation
- Layers: Format → Signature → Algorithm → Claims → Time → Issuer → Revocation → Role → User → Injection
- This is comprehensive security (good!)
- But it meant Story 3 took weeks
- And then Story 9.2 still found an issue

Story 4.3: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security
- Implemented correctly per spec
- But integration with AspectJ (Story 4.4) had bug that wasn't caught
- Bug only discovered when testing Story 9.1 (weeks later)
```

---

## Part 2: Timeline Analysis - Where Velocity Collapsed

### Phases of the Project:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Sep 14 - Sep 20, 1 week)**
```
Stories 1.1-1.4 completed
Status: Green (all stories "PASS" gates or better)
Gate Scores: 78/100 (good foundation)
```

**Phase 2: Core Framework (Sep 21 - Oct 2, ~11 days)**
```
Stories 2.1-2.4 (Walking Skeleton): DONE
Stories 3.1-3.4 (Authentication): DONE
Stories 4.1-4.5 (Multi-tenancy): DONE - but issues begin appearing

Key Issue: Story 4.4 tested in isolation, but integration with Story 8.3 
(jOOQ migration) discovered JPA was wrong choice in Story 2.4
```

**Phase 3: Cascading Rework (Oct 3 - Oct 8, ~5 days)**
```
Stories 5.1-5.3 (Observability): Completed with "PASS" gates
Stories 6.1-6.6 (Flowable BPMN): Completed but heavily scoped

Stories 7.1-7.3 (CLI Framework): Completed
Stories 7.4a-7.4b (Frontend): APPROVED but implementation stalled

Status: Multiple "CONCERNS" gates appearing, high-risk items accumulating
```

**Phase 4: Epic 8 - The Reckoning (Oct 3 - Oct 8)**
```
Story 8.1: Standardize test naming - DONE
Story 8.2: Pre-commit hooks - DONE (88/100 assessment)
Story 8.3: Migrate JPA→jOOQ - DISCOVERED ARCHITECTURAL VIOLATION FROM EPIC 2
Story 8.4: Re-enable disabled tests - FOUND 10+ FAILURES
Story 8.5-8.7: Architectural alignment, mutation testing, nightly pipeline

Key Finding: Epic 8 was supposed to be "code quality + alignment"
But it became "fix what should have been right in Epics 1-7"
```

**Phase 5: MVP Validation Failure (Oct 15 onwards)**
```
Story 9.1: React-Admin consumer app - "Frontend 100% functional, backend broken"
Story 9.2: Fix QueryHandler ExecutionException - ROOT CAUSE TRACE:
  - Tenant context not being set properly
  - TenantDatabaseSessionInterceptor using wrong database connection
  - This is a Story 4.4 issue discovered 5 weeks later

Story 9.3: Fix tenant interceptor pointcut selectivity
  - AspectJ pointcut not matching correctly  
  - Another Story 4.4 issue

Status: MVP cannot validate because foundation is unstable
```

### Velocity Metrics:

```
Week 1 (Sep 14-20):     4 stories completed ✅ Healthy pace
Week 2 (Sep 21-27):     8 stories completed ✅ Accelerating
Week 3 (Sep 28-Oct 4):  12 stories attempted, quality declining
Week 4 (Oct 5-11):      8 stories with rework, foundation issues surfacing  
Week 5 (Oct 12-18):     6 stories, multiple blockers, MVP stalled
Week 6+ (Oct 19+):      Fixes to earlier stories, no forward progress

Total: 49 stories, but effective progress ≈ 30-35 stories of net work
```

---

## Part 3: Specific Examples of Over-Planning Paralysis

### Example 1: Story 7.4a/7.4b Frontend Architecture

**Over-Planning Evidence**:
```
Story 7.4-implementation-handoff.md (91KB document):
- Complete implementation sequence diagram
- Security-first TDD requirements (6 P0 tests, 5 P1 tests, 5 P2 tests)
- Gate decision: CONCERNS (70/100 and 75/100 scores)
- Approved by Sarah (PO) with explicit "Accept CONCERNS" statement

Date: 2025-10-03
Status: "Approved and ready for implementation"

Reality: Neither 7.4a (shell framework) nor 7.4b (generator) were actually built.
The documentation exists, the approval exists, the handoff document exists.
But the code doesn't exist.
```

**Why This Happened**:
The team was approved to work on Story 7.4 with "CONCERNS" gate (70-75/100 risk score). This means:
- 2 high-risk items (score 6)
- Multiple medium-risk items (score 4)
- Documented mitigations but not yet validated

The team prioritized fixing earlier stories (8.2, 8.3, 8.4) instead of starting 7.4 implementation. By the time they could start 7.4, Story 9.1 required it and it was too late.

### Example 2: Story 8.3 - Discovering Architectural Violation 6 Weeks Later

**QA Assessment from Story 8.3**:
```
Status: Done
Business Context: "During Epic 8 investigation, a critical architectural 
violation was identified... WidgetProjection uses JPA @Entity annotation.
Architecture Requirement: tech-stack.md explicitly specifies 'jOOQ for read projections'"

Root Cause: "Epic 2 (Walking Skeleton) used JPA for rapid prototyping; 
jOOQ migration was deferred as technical debt"

Impact: "Architectural non-compliance (tech stack violation)"
```

**The Failure Mode**:
1. Story 2.3: "Implement Read Side (Projection)" - Used JPA for speed
2. Story 2.3 gate: PASS (no architectural validation at the time)
3. Stories 3-7: Continued building on JPA assumption
4. Story 8.3 (week 6): Architectural validation discovered violation
5. Story 8.3 requirement: Rewrite entire projection layer with jOOQ
6. Effort: 5+ days of rework

**How This Could Have Been Prevented**:
- Story 1.2 (Constitutional Quality Gates) should have included architectural compliance check
- Story 2.3 gate review should have validated jOOQ usage
- First architectural violation discovery should have triggered immediate review of all preceding stories

### Example 3: Story 9.2 - Tenant Context Bug Found During MVP Testing

**From Story 9.2**:
```
Business Context: "Epic 9 originally defined Story 9.2 as 'Scaffold and Implement 
Product Aggregate' but this story addresses a P0 blocker from Story 9.1..."

Current State:
- ✅ Frontend sends authenticated requests correctly (JWT with tenant_id, roles)
- ✅ Backend accepts requests (CORS working, authentication passing)
- ❌ QueryGateway.query(FindWidgetsQuery, Page::class.java) throws ExecutionException

Root Cause (identified via code inspection):
"TenantDatabaseSessionInterceptor used DataSource.connection
DataSource.connection.use {} creates NEW connection, not transactional connection
SET LOCAL executed on wrong connection, @Transactional methods never saw variable"
```

**Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier**:
- Story 4.4: "Implement Tenant Context Propagation for Async Processors"
- This story was completed with PASS gates
- Integration tests must have passed
- But the integration wasn't tested with actual query handlers in Story 9.1

**Testing Gap**: The test for Story 4.4 probably tested the interceptor in isolation, not the full chain:
`@Transactional method → AspectJ interceptor → DSLContext → PostgreSQL RLS policy`

---

## Part 4: Process Failures

### 4.1 Gate System Became Rubber Stamp

**CONCERNS Gate Definition**:
> Gate = CONCERNS: "There are identifiable risks but mitigations are in place"

**How It Was Used**:
- Story 7.4a: CONCERNS (70/100) - Approved anyway
- Story 7.4b: CONCERNS (75/100) - Approved anyway  
- Story 4.6: Multiple high risks - Proceeded anyway
- Story 4.7: High risks - Proceeded anyway

**The Problem**: 
CONCERNS gates came from legitimate risk assessments, but they weren't action items. They were just flags that said "good luck, hope it works." The team proceeded at the same velocity as PASS gates.

**What Should Have Happened**:
```
CONCERNS gate on Story 7.4a/7.4b:
✅ Do: "Start with the high-risk security tests (P0), validate they pass, THEN proceed with implementation"
✅ Do: "Create a brief runbook for what to do if high-risk issues surface"  
✗ Don't: "Approve and hope developers remember the 20KB risk assessment document"

Instead: Team proceeded with business-as-usual velocity
```

### 4.2 No Dependency Management Between Stories

**Dependency Issues Found**:

Story 7.4b depends on Story 7.4a:
```
Risk TECH-001: Architectural Dependency on Story 7.4a

Mitigation in story: "Task 3.6 validates framework/admin-shell exists"
```

But the CI/CD or story tracking didn't enforce this. Team could start 7.4b without 7.4a being complete.

Story 8.3 should have blocked earlier:
```
Story 2.3 (Walking Skeleton - Read Projections)
  ↓ (architectural assumption: use JPA)
Stories 3-7 (build on JPA assumption)
  ↓ (weeks pass)
Story 8.3 (discover violation, need rework)
```

No mechanism to validate architectural assumptions during gate reviews of Stories 3-7.

### 4.3 Integration Testing Strategy Was Unit-Test Centric

**Pattern Across Stories**:

Story 4.4 (Tenant Context Propagation):
- Test Design document specifies tests for interceptor
- Probably tests: "aspect fires correctly", "tenant context set"
- Missing integration test: "aspect fires → context set → RLS policy works → query succeeds"

Story 9.2 shows the cascade of missing integration tests:
```
Hypothesis 1: AspectJ pointcut not matching
Hypothesis 2: RLS policy rejection
Hypothesis 3: Query serialization issue
Hypothesis 4: Transaction propagation
Hypothesis 5: Timeout/deadlock

All these hypotheses should have been testable after Story 4.4!
Instead they became investigative work during MVP validation.
```

---

## Part 5: Key Lessons for the New Project

### 5.1 MVP Definition Must Come First

**Current Approach (What Failed)**:
1. Design 9 epics
2. Plan detailed specifications for each
3. Execute stories
4. Hope that Epic 9 (MVP validation) will work

**What Should Happen (New Approach)**:
```
1. Define MVP extremely narrowly:
   ✅ One domain (e.g., Licensing Server)
   ✅ One aggregate (e.g., Product)
   ✅ One end-to-end flow (e.g., Create → Read → List)
   ✅ Full stack: Command → Event → Projection → Query → API → Frontend

2. Build Epics 1-8 ONLY to support MVP end-to-end

3. Every story must contribute to MVP readiness
   - Story 4.4 test MUST include: "Tenant context propagates through query handler"
   - Story 2.3 test MUST include: "Projection persists and queries return data"
   - No deferred dependencies

4. Epic 9 validation happens weekly (not at the end)
   - Each story's merge includes "does MVP still work?"
   - P0 failures block story merge
```

### 5.2 Limit Planning to What Can Be Built in 2 Weeks

**Current Approach**: 91KB handoff document for Story 7.4 with 3-4 weeks of work

**Better Approach**:
```
Story Definition ≤ 2KB
- User story (1 sentence)
- Acceptance criteria (≤ 5 bullets)
- Known dependencies (1 sentence)

Risk Assessment ≤ 1KB
- Top 3 risks (name, why, mitigation)
- No risk score matrix (score inflation)

Test Plan ≤ 1KB  
- Happy path test (1 sentence)
- Top 3 edge cases (1 sentence each)

Total: ≤ 4KB per story

Why: If a story needs 50+ pages of documentation,
     it's too big. Split it into 2-week chunks.
```

### 5.3 Implement Integration Tests First, Unit Tests Second

**Current Approach**:
- Story 4.4 tests: Unit tests of interceptor in isolation
- Story 8.3 tests: Unit tests of jOOQ repository
- Story 9.2: "Let's integrate them and hope for the best"
- Result: Bugs discovered during MVP validation

**Better Approach**:
```
Story 4.4: "Tenant Context Propagation"

Test 1 (P0 - Integration): 
"When @Transactional method queries database with tenant context,
 RLS policy allows SELECT and returns data"
 
Test 2 (P1 - Unit):
"AspectJ interceptor fires before method execution"

Test 3 (P1 - Unit):
"Interceptor sets PostgreSQL session variable correctly"

Requirement: P0 integration test MUST PASS before merge
Unit tests passing without P0 integration = FAIL gate
```

### 5.4 Every Story Merge Must Validate Full MVP

**Current Approach**:
- Each story has its own tests
- Story passes gate → merge
- Hope MVP still works

**Better Approach**:
```
Definition: Core MVP = "Single Product aggregate, CRUD operations, React-Admin frontend"

Every story merge triggers:
1. Full build (Gradle + npm)
2. All unit tests
3. Integration test: Create Product → Query → Update → Delete (20 second smoke test)
4. Frontend smoke test: Load React-Admin, authenticate, display empty list

Pass all 4: ✅ Story merged
Any failure: ❌ Story blocked (fix or rescope)

Result: Stories like 8.3 (jOOQ migration) can't break the system
        Because the MVP smoke test would catch it immediately.
```

### 5.5 No Deferred Architectural Decisions

**Current Approach**:
- Story 2.3: "Use JPA for rapid prototyping"
- Deferred: jOOQ migration to Story 8.3
- Result: 6 weeks of architectural debt

**Better Approach**:
```
Architectural Decision = MUST be in Epic 1, MUST be validated in Epic 2

Story 1.1: Gradle monorepo structure
Story 1.2: Quality gates including architectural compliance check

Story 2.1: Define Widget domain model (FINAL - no prototyping)
Story 2.2: Implement command side with Axon (FINAL)
Story 2.3: Implement read projections with jOOQ (FINAL)

Gate review for Story 2.3:
❌ "Is this using JPA as prototyping hack?" → FAIL gate until fixed

Result: When Story 2.3 completes, architectural decision is validated
        and cannot cause rework 6 weeks later.
```

### 5.6 Risk Scoring Must Include "Acceptance Threshold"

**Current Approach**:
```
Story 7.4a Risk Assessment:
- Risk TECH-001: 6 (HIGH) - Dependency on 7.4a
- Risk SEC-001: 6 (HIGH) - Path traversal attacks
- Gate: CONCERNS (70/100)
- Decision: ACCEPTED, proceed with implementation

Outcome: Story 7.4a never built. But risks still there.
```

**Better Approach**:
```
Every risk gets an "Acceptance Threshold":

Risk TECH-001: Dependency on Story 7.4a
- Score: 6 (HIGH)
- Acceptance Threshold: "Story 7.4a MUST be feature-complete and merged
                         before starting 7.4b Task 3"
- Action: If 7.4a not complete by [DATE], 7.4b story is CANCELED

Risk SEC-001: Path traversal attacks  
- Score: 6 (HIGH)
- Acceptance Threshold: "Security test (7.4b-UNIT-001) must be implemented
                         and passing BEFORE any file generation logic"
- Action: Code review will verify test exists first, blocks if missing

Result: Risks become actionable. Not just documented.
```

### 5.7 Scope Creep Must Be Visible and Explicit

**Current Approach**:
```
Epic 9 definition: "Build Licensing Server MVP"

Stories 9.1-9.3: 
- 9.1: React-Admin Consumer Application (should be Story 8.4 validation)
- 9.2: Fix QueryHandler ExecutionException (not in Epic 9 original scope)
- 9.3: Fix Tenant Interceptor Pointcut (not in Epic 9 original scope)

No explicit "Story Scope Changed" document.
Teams just kept adding stories to Epic 9.
```

**Better Approach**:
```
Every story has a "Scope Change Log":

Story 9.2 Original Scope: "Scaffold and Implement Product Aggregate"
Story 9.2 Actual Scope: "Fix QueryHandler bug from Story 4.4"

Changes:
| Date | From | To | Reason | Approved By |
|------|------|----|---------|----|
| 2025-10-15 | Product Aggregate | QueryHandler Fix | P0 blocker preventing MVP validation | Sarah (PO) |

Effect: Scope creep is visible. Team notices that 25% of Epic 9 became fixing earlier stories.
        This triggers root cause review: "Why is Story 4.4 broken?"
```

---

## Part 6: Recommendations for Fresh Start

### 6.1 Timeline Expectations

**Old Project Estimate**: 9 epics, 49 stories, ~6-8 weeks

**New Project Realistic Plan**:
```
Phase 1: MVP Foundation (2-3 weeks)
- 1 epic: Foundation (Gradle, CI/CD, quality gates)
- 1 epic: Walking Skeleton (1 aggregate end-to-end)
- 1 epic: Security (Auth + tenant isolation, fully integrated)
- Deliverable: Single working aggregate with CRUD

Phase 2: Validation (1 week)
- Use the MVP to build 1 real feature (Licensing Server)
- Document what worked, what didn't
- Fix critical gaps

Phase 3: Scale Out (2-3 weeks)
- Scaffolding CLI, observability, advanced features
- Build on proven foundation

Total: 5-7 weeks, not 8+ weeks with rework

Key: MVP validated by week 3, not week 8
```

### 6.2 Story Size Limits

**Old Approach**:
- Story 7.4: 32KB document, 75/100 risk score, multiple dependencies
- Story 3.3: 42KB document, 10-layer validation system
- Story 6.3: 59KB document, Axon-to-Flowable bridge

**New Approach**:
- Max story size: 2 weeks developer time
- Max story docs: 4KB (story, AC, tests, risks)
- Max story dependencies: 1 previous story (not 4-5)

Stories that would be >2 weeks split into multiple stories with checkpoints.

### 6.3 Gate Decision Framework

**Old Approach**:
```
PASS (90+): Execute normally
CONCERNS (70-89): Execute normally (just documented risks)
FAIL (<70): Blocked
```

**New Approach**:
```
PASS (85+): Execute normally
CONDITIONAL (70-84): Execute ONLY if:
  - Highest risk (score 6) has explicit owner + deadline
  - P0 integration test defined and runnable
  - Blocker criteria defined
FAIL (<70): Blocked until rework
```

### 6.4 Testing Strategy

**Old Approach**: Story gets "test design" document with test scenarios, then implementation happens

**New Approach**:
```
For each high-risk (score 6) item in story:
1. WRITE INTEGRATION TEST FIRST (this is your acceptance test)
2. Make test fail (validates you can run it)
3. Implement feature
4. Make test pass
5. Code review includes: "Does this integration test prove the risk is mitigated?"

Example - Story 4.4 (Tenant Context Propagation):
Highest Risk (score 6): "Tenant context doesn't propagate to database layer"

Integration Test FIRST:
@Test fun `tenant context propagates through AspectJ to RLS policy`() {
    // 1. Set tenant context via ThreadLocal
    TenantContext.setCurrentTenantId("tenant-a")
    
    // 2. Call @Transactional query handler
    val result = widgetQueryHandler.handle(FindWidgetsQuery())
    
    // 3. Assert: results include only tenant-a widgets
    // 4. If RLS policy works, only tenant-a widgets returned
    // 5. If RLS doesn't work, test fails
    assertThat(result.widgets).allMatch { it.tenantId == "tenant-a" }
}

This test VALIDATES the risk is actually mitigated.
Old approach: Test was unit tests of components in isolation.
```

### 6.5 Acceptance Criteria Must Be Testable

**Old Approach**:
Story 4.4 AC: "Tenant context propagates through all async processors"
Translation: Super vague. What's "propagates"? Which processors? How do you test it?

**New Approach**:
Story 4.4 AC:
1. TenantContext.setCurrentTenantId() works from main thread
2. When passed to CompletableFuture task, TenantContext.current() returns same value
3. Integration test validates: Async task sees tenant context without manual propagation
4. Code review: Zero usages of TenantContext without validation in async paths

Every AC has a runnable test that passes/fails.

---

## Part 7: What Worked (Don't Change)

### 7.1 Architecture Style

The Hexagonal + CQRS/ES + Spring Modulith pattern was sound:
- Clear module boundaries ✅
- Event sourcing for audit trail ✅
- Separate read/write models ✅
- Testable, scalable design ✅

Keep this. Don't second-guess.

### 7.2 Technology Choices

Kotlin/Spring Boot/PostgreSQL/Axon stack is appropriate:
- JVM ecosystem well-supported ✅
- PostgreSQL for ACID semantics ✅
- Spring Modulith prevents monolithic creep ✅
- Keycloak OIDC solid choice ✅

Keep these. Don't flip languages or frameworks.

### 7.3 Quality Mindset

The team cared about:
- Zero-tolerance quality gates ✅
- Comprehensive testing ✅
- Security-first TDD ✅
- Architectural compliance ✅

Keep this mindset. But make it actionable (see 5.2-5.6).

### 7.4 Documentation Standards

The level of documentation created is good:
- Architecture decisions documented ✅
- Risk assessments thorough ✅
- Test designs explicit ✅
- Comments explain "why" not "what" ✅

Keep this. Just don't let it become a substitute for working code.

---

## Part 8: Root Cause Analysis - "Why Did This Happen?"

### Fundamental Causes:

1. **Over-Confidence from Planning**:
   - Comprehensive documentation created illusion of control
   - "We've documented everything, so it's under control"
   - Reality: Documentation ≠ Working code

2. **No Clear Definition of "MVP Ready"**:
   - MVP validation was supposed to happen in Epic 9
   - But Epic 9 didn't start until Epics 1-8 were "done"
   - And Epics 1-8 had bugs that only showed up in Epic 9
   - Lesson: MVP must be validated weekly, not at the end

3. **Story Independence Assumption**:
   - Stories 1-8 were treated as independent
   - Gate reviews didn't catch integration issues
   - Story 9.1-9.3 discovered cascading integration issues
   - Lesson: Every story must prove it doesn't break MVP

4. **Risk Acceptance Without Accountability**:
   - Stories 7.4a/7.4b: "CONCERNS - ACCEPTED"
   - But no explicit owner for mitigating the risks
   - No deadline for resolving the risks
   - No escalation if risks materialized
   - Lesson: Risk acceptance requires named owner + deadline

5. **Deferred Architectural Decisions**:
   - "Use JPA for now, migrate to jOOQ later"
   - "Flowable integration can come in Epic 6, not Epic 1"
   - "Frontend generators can be added after MVP"
   - Reality: These debts came due during MVP validation
   - Lesson: Architectural decisions in Epic 2 cannot be deferred

---

## Summary Table: What Failed vs What Worked

| Area | What Failed | What Worked |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Planning** | Too much documentation (49 stories, 200+ assessment docs) | Architecture decisions were fundamentally sound |
| **MVP Definition** | No clear validation gates until week 8 | Deep understanding of requirements (10-layer JWT, etc.) |
| **Testing** | Unit tests in isolation didn't catch integration issues | Comprehensive test design documents (but not executed) |
| **Scope** | Tried to build 9 epics before validating 1 MVP | Security and multi-tenancy concepts were well-researched |
| **Velocity** | Cascading rework, dependencies not explicit | Team had strong technical skills |
| **Risk Management** | CONCERNS gates approved without accountability | Risk assessments were thorough and accurate |
| **Integration** | Found bugs in MVP validation (week 8) instead of week 3 | Quality gates infrastructure (ktlint, detekt) were solid |

## Final Recommendation

**For the New Fresh Start (/Users/michael/eaf)**:

1. ✅ Keep the architecture (Hexagonal/CQRS/ES)
2. ✅ Keep the tech stack (Kotlin/Spring/PostgreSQL)
3. ❌ Eliminate detailed 50KB story documents (4KB max)
4. ❌ Eliminate risk scoring matrices (top 3 risks, that's it)
5. ✅ Keep security-first TDD mindset
6. ❌ Eliminate CONCERNS gates as "proceed anyway" (require owner + deadline)
7. ✅ Keep architectural compliance checking
8. ❌ Eliminate deferred architectural decisions (must be in Epic 2)
9. ✅ Keep comprehensive quality gates
10. ❌ Eliminate MVP validation at the end (validate weekly)

**Success Metric for New Project**:
- Week 3: Single aggregate (Product) working end-to-end with full CRUD + React-Admin
- Week 5: Licensing Server uses framework components from Epic 1-3
- Week 6: Framework publishable, new product can be scaffolded in <1 day

If you hit week 3 with a working MVP, the project will succeed. The old project tried to hit week 8, and the foundation wasn't solid.
