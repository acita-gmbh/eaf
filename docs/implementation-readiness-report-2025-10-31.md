## Project Context

**Project Overview:**
- **Name:** EAF (Enterprise Application Framework)
- **Type:** Software Development Project
- **Classification:** Greenfield Development
- **Project Level:** Level 2
- **Start Date:** 2025-10-30

**Workflow Status:**
- **Current Phase:** Phase 3 (Solutioning)
- **Active Workflow:** solutioning-gate-check (this assessment)
- **Workflow Path:** greenfield-level-2.yaml
- **Current Agent:** Architect

**Phase Completion Status:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1 (Ideation): Complete
- ‚è≥ Phase 2 (Discovery): Product Brief completed (2025-10-30), formal phase not marked complete
- ‚è≥ Phase 3 (Solutioning): Architecture completed (2025-10-30), gate check in progress
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Phase 4 (Implementation): Not started

**Expected Artifacts for Level 2 Project:**

Level 2 projects typically require:
1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - Core requirements and success criteria
2. **Architecture Document** - System design and technology decisions (Note: Level 2 can integrate architecture within tech spec OR as separate document)
3. **Epic and Story Breakdown** - Implementation plan with user stories
4. **Technical Specification** (optional if architecture is separate)

**Completed Workflows:**
- ‚úÖ Product Brief (2025-10-30) - likely serves as PRD foundation
- ‚úÖ Architecture (2025-10-30) - completed using new architecture workflow

**Next Action:**
This gate check validates alignment between PRD, Architecture, and Stories before proceeding to Phase 4 (Implementation).

### Document Analysis Summary

#### Product Requirements Document (PRD) Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Exceptionally comprehensive** - 942 lines covering all aspects of the product
- ‚úÖ **Clear problem statement** with quantified business impact (25% developer overhead, 6+ month onboarding)
- ‚úÖ **Well-defined solution** with validated prototype foundation
- ‚úÖ **Detailed MVP scope** with 8 core features clearly specified
- ‚úÖ **Measurable success criteria** with specific KPIs and metrics
- ‚úÖ **Risk analysis** with mitigation strategies for key risks
- ‚úÖ **Financial impact analysis** with ROI timeline and cost-benefit breakdown
- ‚úÖ **Technology stack fully specified** with versions and rationale
- ‚úÖ **Epic references** throughout document (Epics 1-9 mentioned)

**Coverage:**
- Target users (primary + 4 secondary segments) ‚úÖ
- Goals and success metrics (6 business objectives + 5 KPIs) ‚úÖ
- MVP scope (8 core features, clear out-of-scope items) ‚úÖ
- Post-MVP vision and expansion opportunities ‚úÖ
- Constraints and assumptions well-documented ‚úÖ
- Migration strategy (ZEWSSP then DPCM) ‚úÖ

**Gaps:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è References "epic and story breakdown" in Appendix C but file path points to `/acci_eaf/docs/prd.md` (different repo?)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Epic details (1-9) mentioned throughout but not present as separate documents

#### Architecture Document Analysis

**Strengths:**
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready and comprehensive** (>46,000 tokens)
- ‚úÖ **All technology versions verified** via WebSearch on 2025-10-30/31 (89 decisions documented)
- ‚úÖ **Complete project structure** with detailed directory tree
- ‚úÖ **Epic-to-Architecture mapping** table clearly defines which modules support which epics
- ‚úÖ **Testing strategy** exceptional - 7-layer defense (Static ‚Üí Unit ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Property ‚Üí Fuzz ‚Üí Concurrency ‚Üí Mutation)
- ‚úÖ **Constitutional TDD mandate** with enforcement through Git hooks and CI/CD
- ‚úÖ **Integration points** thoroughly documented
- ‚úÖ **Multi-architecture support** (amd64/arm64/ppc64le) with custom Keycloak build strategy
- ‚úÖ **HA strategy** phased approach (Active-Passive MVP ‚Üí Active-Active Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ **Version verification log** with sources and dates

**Coverage:**
- Technology stack decisions with rationale ‚úÖ
- Project initialization strategy (reuse validated prototype) ‚úÖ
- Module dependency graph ‚úÖ
- Epic implementation sequence (Weeks 1-18) ‚úÖ
- Testing philosophy and patterns ‚úÖ
- Performance budgets and NFRs ‚úÖ

**Gaps:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture assumes epics 1-9 exist as separate planning artifacts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Epic sequencing references 14-18 week timeline but no actual epic files to execute

#### Epic and Story Analysis

**CRITICAL FINDING:**
- ‚ùå **NO EPIC FILES FOUND** - Searched `docs/`, `docs/stories/`, entire project tree
- ‚ùå **NO STORY FILES FOUND** - No user stories or implementation tasks exist
- ‚ùå **Stories directory does not exist** at configured path (`docs/stories/`)

**Impact:**
This is a **BLOCKING GAP** for Phase 4 transition. The Product Brief and Architecture documents are excellent strategic and technical artifacts, but there is no tactical implementation plan. Without epics and stories:
- Developers cannot start implementation (no actionable work items)
- Cannot validate story-to-requirement traceability
- Cannot assess implementation sequencing
- Cannot estimate actual delivery timeline
- Cannot track progress or velocity

**Expected Artifacts for Level 2:**
According to BMM workflow and validation criteria, Level 2 projects require:
1. ‚úÖ PRD (Product Brief serves this purpose)
2. ‚úÖ Architecture (separate document exists, comprehensive)
3. ‚ùå **Epics and Stories** - MISSING

#### Supporting Documents Analysis

**Architecture Validation Report (2025-10-31):**
- Recent validation performed
- Addresses critical architecture issues
- Indicates active quality management

**Version Consistency Report (2025-10-31):**
- Technology version verification
- Ensures stack currency
