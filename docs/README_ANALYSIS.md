## Quick Summary: What Happened

The old project (Sep 14 - Oct 18, 2025) accumulated:
- 49 story files (1,400+ KB of documentation)
- 170+ QA assessment files
- 15+ architecture specification documents
- But only ~30-35 stories of net work completed

**Root Cause**: Over-planning + loss of MVP focus
- Comprehensive documentation created false sense of control
- No MVP validation until week 8 (should have been week 3)
- Integration issues only discovered during final validation
- 5+ critical bugs in foundational stories went undetected for weeks

**Key Insight**: Documentation became a substitute for working code.

### Scenario 5: You Want to Know a Specific Story
Search **eaf_lessons_learned.md** for:
- Story 7.4 (over-planning example)
- Story 8.3 (architectural violation)
- Story 9.2 (integration bug)
- Story 4.4 (unit test isolation)

## The 7 Rules for the New Project

1. **Stories**: 4KB documentation max, 2 weeks work max
2. **Testing**: Integration tests FIRST (P0), unit tests second
3. **MVP**: Validate on every merge, not at the end
4. **Scope**: No deferred architectural decisions
5. **Risk**: CONCERNS gates need owner + deadline
6. **Dependencies**: Only 1 story back (not 5+)
7. **Changes**: Maintain visible scope change log

**Single Most Important Rule**: Every story merge must answer "Does the MVP still work?"

## Key Metrics to Watch

### Old Project (Failed)
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Stories attempted | 49 | ❌ Too many |
| Net progress | ~30-35 | ❌ 30% rework rate |
| MVP validation | Week 8 | ❌ Too late |
| Integration issues | 5+ found at end | ❌ Should catch earlier |
| Documentation | 1,400+ KB | ❌ Too detailed |

### New Project (Target)
| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Week 1 | Foundation + walking skeleton | Validate weekly |
| Week 3 | Full MVP working | Smoke test passes |
| Week 5 | 2-3 aggregates | No rework |
| Stories per week | 3-4 | Sustainable pace |
| Integration bugs | 0 (caught on merge) | MVP validates |

## Implementation Checklist for New Project

- [ ] Set story documentation size limit to 4KB
- [ ] Create MVP smoke test (20 seconds, runs on every merge)
- [ ] Change test strategy: Integration tests FIRST for P0 risks
- [ ] Add "Scope Change Log" template to story definition
- [ ] Make CONCERNS gates require owner + deadline
- [ ] Enforce "only 1 story dependency back" rule
- [ ] Define architectural compliance check in quality gates

## Questions to Ask Yourself

**Before starting a story**:
- Is this story ≤2 weeks of work?
- Does this break the MVP smoke test?
- Does this story have >1 dependency back?

**During a story**:
- Are my P0 tests integration tests?
- Do my tests prove the high-risk items are mitigated?
- Have I documented scope changes?

**Before merging a story**:
- Does the MVP smoke test pass?
- Did any CONCERNS items materialize?
- Is anything deferred that shouldn't be?

## Files Analyzed

**Old Repository** (`/Users/michael/acci_eaf`):
- 49 story files (~1,400 KB)
- 170+ QA assessment files
- 15+ architecture specifications
- Git history showing 6 weeks of development

**Stories Examined**:
- Epic 1-2: Foundation + Walking Skeleton
- Epic 3-4: Authentication + Multi-Tenancy
- Epic 5-6: Observability + Flowable
- Epic 7: CLI Scaffolding
- Epic 8: Code Quality & Alignment (discovered issues from Epic 1-7)
- Epic 9: MVP Validation (blocked by Epic 8 fixes)

**Key Findings**:
- Cascading architectural violations (JPA violation in Epic 2, discovered in Epic 8)
- Integration bugs in critical paths (tenant context, AspectJ pointcut)
- Over-planning created false confidence
- No weekly MVP validation
