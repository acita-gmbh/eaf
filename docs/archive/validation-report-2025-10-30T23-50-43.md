- Gap: Line 117: `LitmusKt | TBD | Epic 8`
- Gap: Line 141: `React-Admin | TBD | Epic 7`
- Impact: Both are explicitly deferred with rationale, acceptable as conscious decisions

---

### 2. Version Specificity (8 items)
**Pass Rate:** 3/8 (38%) - **CRITICAL SECTION**

#### ✓ PASS Items

**[✓] Compatible versions selected**
- Evidence: Axon Framework 4.12.1 compatible with PostgreSQL 16.6 (lines 700-704)

- Shows deliberate choice of LTS for stability

**[⚠] Breaking changes between versions noted if relevant**
- Evidence: Line 704: "Migration to Axon 5.x planned Q3-Q4 2026 (1-1.5 months effort)"
- Gap: No breaking changes documented for other major version migrations

#### ⚠ PARTIAL Items

**[⚠] Every technology choice includes a specific version number**
- Evidence: 88 decisions documented, most with specific versions
- Gap: Line 128: `Docker Compose | Latest` (no specific version)
- Gap: Line 133: `Grafana | Latest` (no specific version)
- Impact: "Latest" is problematic for reproducibility and version pinning

#### ✗ FAIL Items

**[✗] Version numbers are current (verified via WebSearch, not hardcoded)** - CRITICAL
- Gap: No explicit evidence that WebSearch was used for version verification
- Gap: Checklist explicitly requires: "WebSearch used during workflow to verify current versions"
- Impact: Without WebSearch verification, versions could be outdated or incorrect

**[✗] Verification dates noted for version checks** - CRITICAL
- Gap: No verification dates documented
- Impact: Impossible to determine when versions were last checked

**[✗] WebSearch used during workflow to verify current versions** - CRITICAL
- Gap: No evidence of WebSearch usage in document
- Impact: Critical checklist requirement not met

#### ➖ N/A Items

**[➖] No hardcoded versions from decision catalog trusted without verification**
- Reason: No explicit "decision catalog" hardcoded versions identified

- Evidence: Source column differentiates: "Prototype", "Analysis (NEW)", "Product Brief"
- Clear separation between prototype and new decisions

**[✓] No duplicate decisions that starter already makes**
- Evidence: Each decision has unique Source attribution, no conflicts identified

#### ⚠ PARTIAL Items

**[⚠] Starter template version is current and specified**
- Evidence: Prototype location specified: `/Users/michael/acci_eaf` (line 24)
- Gap: Prototype has no "version" in classical sense (local repository)
- Impact: Unclear which version of prototype is canonical source

**[⚠] Command search term provided for verification**

- Mitigation: EAF is enterprise framework, not simple CRUD. Complexity justified by ADRs
- Scaffolding CLI (70-80% boilerplate elimination), 12-week onboarding, Golden Path docs

**[⚠] Standard patterns used where possible (starter templates leveraged)**
- Custom prototype instead of standard starter
- Justified by ADR-009 (lines 3506-3534): Standard starters provide <30% coverage

**[⚠] Maintenance complexity appropriate for team size**
- Evidence: Very complex stack
- Mitigation: Scaffolding CLI, 12-week tiered onboarding (ADR-006), Golden Path documentation
- Impact: Junior developer (Majlinda) transitioning to complex stack - onboarding challenge

---

## Failed Items

### CRITICAL FAILURES

#### 1. Version Verification Not Documented (Section 2)
**Items:**
- Version numbers are current (verified via WebSearch, not hardcoded)
- Verification dates noted for version checks
- WebSearch used during workflow to verify current versions

**Impact:** HIGH - Without WebSearch verification and verification dates, it's impossible to confirm that all 88 technology versions are current and correct. This is a critical checklist requirement.

**Evidence of Gap:**
- No "verified on", "checked on", "WebSearch" references in document
- Document date is 2025-10-30, versions appear current, but no verification proof

**Recommendation:** Must add verification section showing:
```
## Version Verification Log
All versions verified via WebSearch on 2025-10-30:

- Kotlin 2.2.21: Current stable (verified https://kotlinlang.org/docs/releases.html)
- Spring Boot 3.5.7: Current stable (verified https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- PostgreSQL 16.6: Current stable (verified https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/)
[... continue for all 88 decisions]
```

#### 2. Non-Specific Versions ("Latest") (Section 2)
**Items:**
- Docker Compose | Latest (line 128)
- Grafana | Latest (line 133)

**Impact:** MEDIUM - "Latest" is problematic for reproducibility and version pinning. Deployments could use different versions over time.

**Recommendation:** Must specify exact versions:
```
- Docker Compose | 2.24.1 (verified 2025-10-30)
- Grafana | 11.4.0 (verified 2025-10-30, Post-MVP)
```

---

## Partial Items

### 1. TBD Placeholders (Section 1)
**Items:**
- LitmusKt | TBD (line 117)
- React-Admin | TBD (line 141)

**Status:** Acceptable - Both explicitly deferred with rationale
- LitmusKt: Epic 8 (ADR-008 explains 5-7 day integration)
- React-Admin: Epic 7 (version will be determined during frontend implementation)

**Recommendation:** Consider adding planned timeframe for version determination in Decision Summary table.

---

### 2. Missing Sequence Diagrams (Section 4)
**Complex Patterns Without Sequence Diagrams:**
- Axon-Flowable Bridge
- 3-Layer Multi-Tenancy

**Impact:** LOW - Textual flow documentation exists, but visual sequence diagrams would enhance understanding for complex bidirectional integrations.

**Recommendation:** Add ASCII sequence diagrams for:
1. Axon-Flowable Bridge bidirectional flow
2. 3-Layer Multi-Tenancy request lifecycle (JWT → Filter → Context → Validator → RLS)

Example:
```
Axon-Flowable Bridge Sequence:
┌────────┐      ┌────────┐      ┌─────────┐      ┌─────────┐
│ BPMN   │      │ Bridge │      │  Axon   │      │  Event  │
│ Task   │      │Delegate│      │ Gateway │      │  Store  │
└───┬────┘      └───┬────┘      └────┬────┘      └────┬────┘
    │               │                │                │
    │ execute()     │                │                │
    │──────────────>│                │                │
    │               │ send(command)  │                │
    │               │───────────────>│                │
    │               │                │ persist event  │
    │               │                │───────────────>│
```

---

### 3. Complexity vs. Team Size (Section 10)
**Concern:** Very complex stack for junior developer onboarding

**Mitigations Present:**
- Scaffolding CLI eliminates 70-80% boilerplate
- 12-week tiered onboarding (ADR-006)
- Golden Path documentation (Epic 7.5, 4 weeks)
- Pair programming budget

**Status:** Acceptable with mitigations, but requires execution discipline

**Recommendation:** Ensure Epic 7.5 (Documentation) completes BEFORE Epic 9 (Majlinda validation) as documented.

---

### 4. Minor Implementation Pattern Gaps (Section 5)
**Gaps:**
- SQL query formatting/style not explicitly covered
- BPMN process file naming convention implicit
- Docker image naming implicit

**Impact:** VERY LOW - ktlint/Detekt handle Kotlin, examples provide implicit guidance

**Recommendation:** Optional - Add explicit section for:
```
### SQL Formatting
- Use uppercase keywords: SELECT, FROM, WHERE
- Indent JOIN clauses
- One condition per line for complex WHERE

### BPMN File Naming
- Pattern: {domain}-{action}.bpmn20.xml
- Example: widget-approval.bpmn20.xml

### Docker Image Naming
- Pattern: ghcr.io/{org}/{component}:{version}
- Example: ghcr.io/axians/eaf-keycloak:26.4.0
```

---

### 5. Prototype Version Unclear (Section 3)
**Item:** Starter template version is current and specified

**Gap:** Prototype at `/Users/michael/acci_eaf` has no version tag or Git commit reference

**Impact:** LOW - Prototype is local and validated, but unclear which "version" is canonical

**Recommendation:** Add Git reference in Project Initialization:
```
# Clone validated prototype structure:
git clone /Users/michael/acci_eaf eaf-v1
cd eaf-v1
git checkout tags/v1.0-validated  # Use specific validated tag

# Or document commit:
# Prototype source: /Users/michael/acci_eaf @ commit abc1234 (validated 2025-10-30)
```

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Critical)

1. **Add Version Verification Section** - CRITICAL
   - Document WebSearch verification for all 88 technology versions
   - Include verification date (2025-10-30)
   - Provide verification sources (official websites, release notes)
   - Update checklist evidence showing this verification was performed

2. **Replace "Latest" with Specific Versions** - CRITICAL
   - Docker Compose: Specify exact version (e.g., 2.24.1)
   - Grafana: Specify exact version (e.g., 11.4.0)
   - Update Decision Summary table (lines 128, 133)

### Should Improve

3. **Add Sequence Diagrams for Complex Patterns** - RECOMMENDED
   - Axon-Flowable Bridge bidirectional flow
   - 3-Layer Multi-Tenancy request lifecycle
   - Visual diagrams enhance agent understanding

4. **Add Prototype Version Reference** - RECOMMENDED
   - Git tag or commit hash for prototype source
   - Ensures reproducibility of "validated" prototype structure

5. **Document SQL/BPMN/Docker Naming Explicitly** - OPTIONAL
   - Add explicit patterns for SQL formatting, BPMN file naming, Docker image naming
   - Currently implicit via examples, explicit would eliminate any ambiguity

### Consider

6. **Monitor Onboarding Complexity** - TRACK
   - Very complex stack for junior developer
   - Mitigations in place (CLI, docs, onboarding)
   - Ensure Epic 7.5 completes BEFORE Epic 9 as critical dependency

7. **Update Quarterly Review Calendar** - OPTIONAL
   - Add quarterly version review process to keep architecture current
   - Align with Keycloak ppc64le rebuild schedule (quarterly)

---

## Validation Summary Scores

### Document Quality Score

- **Architecture Completeness:** Complete (88 decisions documented, all major areas covered)
- **Version Specificity:** Mostly Verified (missing verification documentation, 2 "Latest" entries)
- **Pattern Clarity:** Crystal Clear (✅/❌ examples, FORBIDDEN markers, comprehensive)
- **AI Agent Readiness:** Ready (sufficient detail for implementation, clear boundaries, no ambiguity)

### Overall Assessment

**Status:** **READY WITH CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED**

The EAF v1.0 Architecture Document is comprehensive, well-structured, and provides excellent guidance for AI agents. It demonstrates industry-leading practices with 7-layer testing, 10-layer JWT validation, and thoughtful novel pattern design.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive decision coverage (88 decisions)
- Excellent AI agent clarity (✅/❌ examples, FORBIDDEN patterns)
- Production-proven technology stack
- Clear implementation patterns with code examples
- Novel patterns well-documented with implementation guidance
- Strong security architecture (10-layer JWT, 3-layer tenancy, fail-closed design)

**Critical Gaps:**
- **Version verification not documented** (WebSearch evidence, verification dates)
- **Non-specific versions** (Docker Compose, Grafana as "Latest")

These gaps are straightforward to fix and do not undermine the overall architecture quality. Once version verification is documented and "Latest" entries are replaced with specific versions, the document will meet all checklist requirements at a high standard.

**Recommendation:** Address critical version verification issues before proceeding to solutioning-gate-check workflow.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Address Critical Fixes:**
   - Add Version Verification Section with WebSearch evidence
   - Replace "Latest" with specific versions

2. **Optional Improvements:**
   - Add sequence diagrams for Axon-Flowable Bridge and Multi-Tenancy
   - Document prototype Git reference

3. **After Fixes Complete:**
   - Re-run this validation to confirm all items pass
   - Proceed to **solutioning-gate-check** workflow for cross-document validation (PRD → Architecture → Stories alignment)

---

**Next Step:** Run the **solutioning-gate-check** workflow to validate alignment between PRD, Architecture, and Stories before beginning implementation.

---

_This validation validates architecture document quality only. Use solutioning-gate-check for comprehensive readiness validation._
