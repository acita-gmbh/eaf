# EAF Documentation Archive

**Purpose:** Historical analysis documents from initial architecture development phase (2025-10-30)

**Archived Date:** 2025-10-31
**Reason:** Version inconsistencies identified during architecture validation - documents contain outdated technology versions superseded by current standards

## Historical Context

These documents represent the analytical foundation for EAF v1.0 architecture decisions. While version numbers are outdated, the **architectural analysis, patterns, and decision rationale remain valid**.

**Key Insights Preserved:**
- Multi-architecture support business case (â‚¬22K savings through early adoption)
- Developer experience design principles (Scaffolding CLI, Nullable Pattern, Constitutional TDD)
- Technology compatibility matrices and migration triggers
- Performance optimization strategies and benchmark targets

**Usage Recommendation:**
- Refer to these documents for **context and rationale** behind architectural decisions
- Always verify version numbers against current `architecture.md` before implementation
- Consider these as "point-in-time" snapshots of the analysis process

---

## Archival Policy

**Retention:** Indefinite (historical value for future architectural reviews)
**Review Schedule:** Quarterly review aligned with version verification cycle
**Deletion Criteria:** None - documents provide valuable decision context

**Future Archival:**
- When major versions change (e.g., Spring Boot 4.x, Axon 5.x), create new analysis documents
- Archive previous versions following same pattern
- Maintain lineage for architectural decision history
