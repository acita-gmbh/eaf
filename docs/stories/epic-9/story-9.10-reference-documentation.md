**Status:** TODO

## User Story

As an EAF developer,
I want complete reference documentation,
So that I can look up specifications, configurations, and API details.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ docs/reference/ directory with comprehensive references:
   - architecture-decisions.md (links to architecture.md)
   - api-documentation.md (REST API reference, all endpoints)
   - configuration-reference.md (application.yml properties)
   - cli-commands.md (all scaffold commands)
   - testing-reference.md (7-layer testing strategy)
2. ✅ Each reference complete and accurate
3. ✅ Auto-generated content where possible (OpenAPI → API docs)
4. ✅ Version-specific references (EAF v1.0)
5. ✅ Quick reference tables and cheat sheets
