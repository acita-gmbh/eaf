# Story 4.10: LitmusKt Concurrency Testing for TenantContext

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR004, FR014 (Data Consistency - Concurrency Control)

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want concurrency stress tests for TenantContext ThreadLocal management,
So that race conditions and memory model violations are detected.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ LitmusKt dependency added (version TBD, JetBrains Research)
2. ✅ Concurrency tests in litmusTest/kotlin/ source set:
   - TenantContextIsolationTest.kt (validates no cross-thread context leakage)
   - EventProcessorPropagationTest.kt (validates async propagation correctness)
   - ConnectionPoolContextTest.kt (validates context with pooled connections)
3. ✅ Tests run with multiple thread scenarios (2, 4, 8, 16 threads)
4. ✅ Memory model violations detected and prevented
5. ✅ Tests integrated into nightly CI/CD
6. ✅ All concurrency tests pass without race conditions
7. ✅ LitmusKt testing documented
