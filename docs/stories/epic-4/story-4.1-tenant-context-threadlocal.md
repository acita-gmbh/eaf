# Story 4.1: TenantContext and ThreadLocal Management

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR004 (Multi-Tenancy with Isolation and Quotas)

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want ThreadLocal-based tenant context storage,
So that tenant ID is available throughout request processing without parameter passing.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ framework/multi-tenancy module created
2. ✅ TenantId.kt value object with validation
3. ✅ TenantContext.kt manages ThreadLocal storage with stack-based context
4. ✅ TenantContextHolder.kt provides static access (get/set/clear methods)
5. ✅ WeakReference used for memory safety (prevent ThreadLocal leaks)
6. ✅ Unit tests validate: set context → retrieve → clear
7. ✅ Thread isolation validated (context not shared between threads)
8. ✅ Context cleared after request completion (filter cleanup)

---

## Prerequisites

**Epic 3 complete** - JWT validation must extract tenant_id
