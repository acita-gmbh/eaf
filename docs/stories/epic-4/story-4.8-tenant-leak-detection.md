**Epic:** Epic 4 - Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR004, FR005 (Observability)

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want monitoring and alerting for tenant context leaks,
So that isolation violations are detected immediately.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Metrics emitted: tenant_context_missing, tenant_context_mismatch, cross_tenant_access_attempts
2. ✅ Security audit log for all tenant isolation violations
3. ✅ Structured JSON log includes: violation_type, user_id, attempted_tenant, actual_tenant, trace_id
4. ✅ Alerting rules configured in Prometheus for isolation violations
5. ✅ Dashboard query templates for tenant isolation monitoring
6. ✅ Integration test validates metrics are emitted on violations
7. ✅ Leak detection documented in docs/reference/security-monitoring.md
