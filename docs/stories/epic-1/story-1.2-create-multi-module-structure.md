# Story 1.2: Create Multi-Module Structure

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Project Infrastructure
**Status:** ready-for-dev
**Story Points:** TBD
**Related Requirements:** FR001, FR010 (Hexagonal Architecture)
**Context File:** docs/stories/epic-1/1-2-create-multi-module-structure.context.xml

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want to establish the multi-module monorepo structure (framework/, products/, shared/, apps/, tools/),
So that I have a logical organization matching the architectural design.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Directory structure created: framework/, products/, shared/, apps/, tools/, docker/, scripts/, docs/
2. ✅ Each top-level directory has build.gradle.kts
3. ✅ settings.gradle.kts includes all modules
4. ✅ Framework submodules defined: core, security, multi-tenancy, cqrs, persistence, observability, workflow, web
5. ✅ All modules compile with empty src/ directories
6. ✅ ./gradlew projects lists all modules correctly

---

## Prerequisites

**Story 1.1** - Initialize Repository (must be completed)

---

## Technical Notes

### Module Structure (from architecture.md Section 5)

```
eaf-v1/
├── framework/                    # Core Framework Modules
│   ├── core/
│   ├── security/
│   ├── multi-tenancy/
│   ├── cqrs/
│   ├── persistence/
│   ├── observability/
│   ├── workflow/
│   └── web/
├── products/                     # Product Implementations
│   └── widget-demo/
├── shared/                       # Shared Libraries
│   ├── shared-api/
│   ├── shared-types/
│   └── testing/

├── scripts/                      # Shell scripts
└── docs/                         # Documentation
```

### Spring Modulith Preparation

This structure will be enforced by Spring Modulith 1.4.4 (Story 1.8). Each framework module must be a valid Spring Modulith module.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create top-level directories (framework/, products/, shared/, apps/, tools/, docker/, scripts/, docs/)
- [ ] Create framework submodules: core, security, multi-tenancy, cqrs, persistence, observability, workflow, web
- [ ] Create build.gradle.kts for each module (empty configuration)
- [ ] Update settings.gradle.kts to include all modules
- [ ] Create empty src/main/kotlin/ and src/test/kotlin/ directories in each module
- [ ] Run `./gradlew projects` - verify all modules listed
- [ ] Run `./gradlew build` - verify compilation succeeds
- [ ] Commit: "Create multi-module monorepo structure"

---

## Test Evidence

- [ ] `./gradlew projects` shows all 8 framework modules
- [ ] `./gradlew build` compiles successfully (empty modules)
- [ ] Each module has build.gradle.kts
- [ ] settings.gradle.kts includes all modules

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All modules compile
- [ ] Module structure matches architecture.md Section 5
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] Story marked as DONE in workflow status

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference
- Story Context: `docs/stories/epic-1/1-2-create-multi-module-structure.context.xml` (generated 2025-11-01)

### Debug Log

**Implementation Plan (2025-11-01):**

**Current State Analysis:**
- ✅ Most top-level directories exist: framework/, products/, shared/, apps/, tools/, docs/, monitoring/
- ❌ Missing: docker/, scripts/
- ✅ Framework modules exist: core, security, cqrs, observability, workflow, persistence, web
- ❌ **CRITICAL: Missing multi-tenancy module** (required per AC4 and Context constraints)
- ⚠️ Extra admin-shell/ module exists (not in spec, will leave as-is for now)
- ✅ All existing modules have build.gradle.kts files
- ❌ settings.gradle.kts missing multi-tenancy inclusion

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Create missing top-level directories (docker/, scripts/)
2. Create framework/multi-tenancy/ with proper structure
3. Create build.gradle.kts for multi-tenancy module (following core/ pattern)
4. Update settings.gradle.kts to include framework:multi-tenancy
5. Verify all modules have src/main/kotlin/ and src/test/kotlin/ directories
6. Run ./gradlew projects to verify module list
7. Run ./gradlew build to verify compilation
8. Commit changes
