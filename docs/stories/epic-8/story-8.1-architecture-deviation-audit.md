# Story 8.1: Architectural Deviation Audit

**Epic:** Epic 8 - Code Quality & Architectural Alignment
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR010 (Hexagonal Architecture)

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want a systematic audit comparing implementation to architecture.md specifications,
So that I can identify and document all deviations that accumulated during development.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Audit checklist created based on architecture.md decisions (89 decisions)
2. ✅ All framework modules reviewed against architectural specifications
3. ✅ Deviations documented with: location, severity (critical/high/medium/low), resolution plan
4. ✅ Naming pattern compliance validated (files, packages, database tables)
5. ✅ Module boundary violations identified via Konsist
6. ✅ Technology version consistency validated (architecture.md vs actual dependencies)
7. ✅ Audit report generated: docs/architecture-alignment-audit-{{date}}.md
8. ✅ Deviation count and severity distribution documented

## Prerequisites

**Epic 7 complete**
