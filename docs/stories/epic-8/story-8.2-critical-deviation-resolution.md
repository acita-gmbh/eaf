# Story 8.2: Critical Deviation Resolution

**Epic:** Epic 8 - Code Quality & Architectural Alignment
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR010

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want all critical architectural deviations resolved,
So that implementation fully conforms to architectural decisions.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ All CRITICAL deviations from Story 8.1 resolved
2. ✅ Code refactored to match architectural patterns
3. ✅ Naming corrected to follow conventions (FR → functional requirement pattern)
4. ✅ Module boundaries corrected (no cyclic dependencies)
5. ✅ All critical fixes tested (unit + integration tests)
6. ✅ Konsist architecture tests pass
7. ✅ Resolution validated with re-audit
8. ✅ Zero critical deviations remain
