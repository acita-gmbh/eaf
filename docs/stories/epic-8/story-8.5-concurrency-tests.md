# Story 8.5: Concurrency Tests for Critical Components

**Epic:** Epic 8 - Code Quality & Architectural Alignment
**Status:** TODO

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want comprehensive concurrency tests for ThreadLocal and async components,
So that race conditions are prevented in production.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ TenantContext concurrency tests expanded (from Epic 4 Story 4.10)
2. ✅ Event Processor propagation concurrency tests
3. ✅ Connection pool context tests
4. ✅ Redis cache concurrency tests (revocation store)
5. ✅ Distributed lock tests (if implemented)
6. ✅ All tests run with 2, 4, 8, 16 thread scenarios
7. ✅ Memory model violations detected and fixed
8. ✅ All concurrency tests pass in nightly CI/CD (~20-30 minutes)
