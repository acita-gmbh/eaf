# Story 8.9: Git Hooks Enhancement and Enforcement

**Epic:** Epic 8 - Code Quality & Architectural Alignment
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR008, FR025

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want enhanced Git hooks that enforce TDD and quality gates strictly,
So that quality issues never reach the main branch.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Pre-commit hook enhanced: ktlint + test existence check (<10s)
2. ✅ Pre-push hook enhanced: Detekt + unit tests + integration tests (<5min)
3. ✅ Hooks cannot be bypassed without explicit --no-verify (discouraged, logged)
4. ✅ Hook bypass requires justification in commit message
5. ✅ CI/CD validates hooks were not bypassed
6. ✅ Hook violations logged and metrics tracked
7. ✅ Enhanced hooks documented in CONTRIBUTING.md
