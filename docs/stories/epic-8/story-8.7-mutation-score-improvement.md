# Story 8.7: Mutation Score Improvement

**Epic:** Epic 8 - Code Quality & Architectural Alignment
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR008

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want improved test quality to meet mutation coverage targets,
So that tests are effective at catching real bugs.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Mutation testing baseline measured for all modules
2. ✅ Weak tests identified (mutations survive)
3. ✅ Tests improved to kill surviving mutations
4. ✅ Target mutation score achieved: 60-70% across framework modules
5. ✅ Critical paths (security, multi-tenancy) achieve >75% mutation score
6. ✅ Mutation score tracked in CI/CD
7. ✅ Mutation improvement strategies documented
