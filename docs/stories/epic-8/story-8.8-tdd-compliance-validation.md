## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want validation that all production code follows Constitutional TDD (test-first),
So that TDD discipline is enforced project-wide.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Git history audit validates RED-GREEN-REFACTOR commit patterns
2. ✅ All production code has corresponding tests
3. ✅ Test coverage >85% validated via Kover
4. ✅ No production code committed without tests
5. ✅ TDD violation detection in code review checklist
6. ✅ Pre-commit hooks enforce test existence (fail if new code has no tests)
7. ✅ TDD compliance report generated
8. ✅ TDD compliance metrics tracked
