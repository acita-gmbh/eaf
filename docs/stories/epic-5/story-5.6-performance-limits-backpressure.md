# Story 5.6: Observability Performance Limits and Backpressure

**Epic:** Epic 5 - Observability & Monitoring
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR005, FR011, FR018 (Resilience)

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want enforced performance limits on observability components,
So that logging/metrics/tracing never impact application performance >1%.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Log rotation configured: daily rotation, 7-day retention, max 1GB per day
2. ✅ Intelligent trace sampling: 100% errors, 10% success (configurable)
3. ✅ Metric collection performance validated: <1% CPU overhead
4. ✅ Backpressure handling: drop telemetry data when systems unavailable (don't block application)
5. ✅ Performance test validates: observability overhead <1% under load
6. ✅ Circuit breaker for telemetry exports (fail-open on errors)
7. ✅ Performance limits documented in architecture.md

## Prerequisites

**Story 5.5** - OpenTelemetry Distributed Tracing
