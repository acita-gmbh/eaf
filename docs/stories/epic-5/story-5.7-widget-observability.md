# Story 5.7: Widget Demo Observability Enhancement

**Epic:** Epic 5 - Observability & Monitoring
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR005, FR027 (Business Metrics)

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want Widget demo enhanced with custom business metrics and structured logging,
So that the demo demonstrates observability capabilities.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Widget aggregate emits custom metrics: widget_created_total, widget_published_total, widget_processing_duration
2. ✅ Widget API logs structured messages with business context
3. ✅ Widget command/event processing traced with OpenTelemetry spans
4. ✅ Integration test validates: create widget → metrics incremented, logs emitted, traces captured
5. ✅ Prometheus metrics visible at /actuator/prometheus
6. ✅ Log correlation validated (all logs for single request share trace_id)
7. ✅ Custom metrics documented as example pattern
