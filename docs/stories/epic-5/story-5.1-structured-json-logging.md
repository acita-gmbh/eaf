# Story 5.1: Structured JSON Logging with Logback

**Epic:** Epic 5 - Observability & Monitoring
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR005 (Observability with Performance Limits)

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want structured JSON logging configured with Logback and Logstash encoder,
So that logs are machine-parsable and queryable in log aggregation systems.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ framework/observability module created with Logback and Logstash encoder dependencies
2. ✅ logback-spring.xml configures JSON logging format
3. ✅ Log entries include mandatory fields: timestamp, level, logger, message, service_name, thread
4. ✅ ConsoleAppender for local development (pretty-printed JSON)
5. ✅ FileAppender configuration for production (rotated daily)
6. ✅ Integration test validates JSON structure and required fields
7. ✅ Log output validated as valid JSON

## Prerequisites

**Epic 4 complete**
