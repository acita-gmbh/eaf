# Story 7.10: CLI Testing and Validation

**Epic:** Epic 7 - Scaffolding CLI & Developer Tooling
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR002

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want comprehensive CLI tests,
So that scaffold commands work reliably across different scenarios.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Unit tests for all scaffold commands (module, aggregate, api-resource, projection, ra-resource)
2. ✅ Integration tests validate end-to-end generation workflow
3. ✅ Edge case tests: invalid names, existing files, missing modules
4. ✅ Test validates: generated code compiles, tests pass, quality gates pass
5. ✅ CLI error handling tested (clear error messages)
6. ✅ Test execution time <2 minutes
7. ✅ CLI test coverage >85%
