# Story 7.9: Template Validation and Quality Gate Compliance

**Epic:** Epic 7 - Scaffolding CLI & Developer Tooling
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR002, FR008, NFR003

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want all generated code to immediately pass quality gates,
So that developers can use scaffolded code without manual fixes.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ All templates validated: generated code passes ktlint formatting
2. ✅ Generated code passes Detekt static analysis
3. ✅ Generated code passes Konsist architecture validation
4. ✅ Generated tests compile and pass
5. ✅ Pre-generation validation catches invalid names (reserved keywords, invalid characters)
6. ✅ Post-generation validation runs quality gates automatically
7. ✅ Integration test: scaffold aggregate → run ./gradlew check → all gates pass
8. ✅ Template quality CI/CD pipeline validates templates on every change
