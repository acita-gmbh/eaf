# Story 3.12: Security Fuzz Testing with Jazzer

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Authentication & Authorization
**Status:** TODO
**Story Points:** TBD
**Related Requirements:** FR006, NFR002 (OWASP ASVS L2)

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want fuzz tests for JWT validation components,
So that security vulnerabilities and edge cases are discovered automatically.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Jazzer 0.25.1 dependency added to framework/security
2. ✅ Fuzz tests created in fuzzTest/kotlin/ source set:
   - JwtFormatFuzzer.kt (fuzzes token format parsing)
   - TokenExtractorFuzzer.kt (fuzzes Bearer token extraction)
   - RoleNormalizationFuzzer.kt (fuzzes role claim structures)
3. ✅ Each fuzz test runs 5 minutes (total 15 minutes for 3 security targets)
4. ✅ Corpus caching enabled for regression prevention
5. ✅ Fuzz tests integrated into nightly CI/CD pipeline
6. ✅ All fuzz tests pass without crashes or DoS conditions
7. ✅ Discovered vulnerabilities documented and fixed
