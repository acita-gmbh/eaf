# Story 3.7: User Validation and Injection Detection (Layers 9-10)

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Authentication & Authorization
**Status:** TODO
**Story Points:** TBD
**Related Requirements:** FR006, NFR002 (OWASP ASVS)

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want user existence validation and SQL/XSS injection detection in JWT claims,
So that tokens reference valid users and don't contain malicious payloads.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Layer 9 (optional): User validation - check user exists and is active (configurable, performance trade-off)
2. ✅ Layer 10: Injection detection - regex patterns for SQL/XSS in all string claims
3. ✅ Invalid users rejected with 401
4. ✅ Injection patterns detected and rejected with 400 Bad Request
5. ✅ Fuzz test with Jazzer targets injection detection (SQL patterns, XSS payloads)
6. ✅ Performance impact measured (<5ms per request)
7. ✅ User validation can be disabled via configuration for performance
