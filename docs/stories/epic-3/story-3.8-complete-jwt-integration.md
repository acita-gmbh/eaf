# Story 3.8: Complete 10-Layer JWT Validation Integration

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Authentication & Authorization
**Status:** TODO
**Story Points:** TBD
**Related Requirements:** FR006, NFR002

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want all 10 JWT validation layers integrated into a single filter chain,
So that every API request passes through comprehensive security validation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ JwtValidationFilter.kt orchestrates all 10 layers in sequence
2. ✅ Validation failure at any layer short-circuits (fails fast)
3. ✅ Successful validation populates Spring SecurityContext
4. ✅ Validation metrics emitted per layer (validation_layer_duration, validation_failures_by_layer)
5. ✅ Integration test validates all 10 layers with comprehensive scenarios
6. ✅ Performance validated: <50ms total validation time
7. ✅ All 10 layers documented in docs/reference/jwt-validation.md
