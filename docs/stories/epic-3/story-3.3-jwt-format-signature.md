# Story 3.3: JWT Format and Signature Validation (Layers 1-2)

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Authentication & Authorization
**Status:** TODO
**Story Points:** TBD
**Related Requirements:** FR006, NFR002

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want JWT format and RS256 signature validation,
So that only properly formed and signed tokens are accepted.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ JwtValidationFilter.kt implements Layer 1 (format: 3-part structure) and Layer 2 (signature validation)
2. ✅ Token extraction from Authorization Bearer header
3. ✅ RS256 algorithm enforcement (reject HS256)
4. ✅ Invalid format tokens rejected with 401 and clear error message
5. ✅ Invalid signature tokens rejected with 401
6. ✅ Unit tests with Nullable Pattern for validation logic
7. ✅ Integration test validates both layers with real Keycloak tokens
