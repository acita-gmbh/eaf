# Story 10.8: Nullable Pattern Performance Benchmarking

**Epic:** Epic 10 - Reference Application for MVP Validation
**Status:** TODO
**Related Requirements:** FR011, NFR001, NFR003

---

## User Story

As a framework developer,
I want performance benchmarks comparing Nullable Pattern to traditional mocking,
So that I can validate the 60%+ speed improvement claim.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Benchmark tests created: Nullable vs Mockk/MockBean for Widget business logic
2. ✅ Scenarios benchmarked: simple validation, complex business rules, multiple collaborators
3. ✅ Benchmark results measured: test execution time, memory usage
4. ✅ Target validated: Nullable Pattern >60% faster than mocking frameworks
5. ✅ Results documented in docs/reference/nullable-pattern-benchmarks.md
6. ✅ Benchmarks runnable via: ./gradlew :products:widget-demo:benchmark
7. ✅ Results included in Epic 10 Reference Application summary
