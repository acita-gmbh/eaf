**Pass Rate:** 36/43 (83.7%)

### ⚠ Technology Versions

- [x] Every technology choice includes specific version number **EXCEPT** React-Admin (TBD)
- [⚠] Version numbers are current - **MOSTLY VERIFIED with 2 ISSUES:**
  - **CRITICAL:** Spring Modulith 1.4.3 → Should be 1.4.4 (Oct 27, 2025)
  - **WARNING:** Axon Framework 4.12.1 verification inconclusive

### ✅ Version Verification Process

- [x] WebSearch used during workflow to verify current versions
- [x] No hardcoded versions from decision catalog trusted without verification
- [x] LTS vs. latest versions considered and documented

**Evidence:**
- Lines 20-84: Complete "Version Verification Log" section with sources and dates
- Line 78: "Axon 5.x migration planned Q3-Q4 2026 (1-1.5 months effort documented)"

---

## 3. Starter Template Integration

**Pass Rate:** 6/11 (54.5%)

### ⚠ Template Selection

- [⚠] Starter template chosen OR "from scratch" decision documented - **ISSUE:** Prototype reuse not explicitly documented as "starter alternative"
- [x] Project initialization command documented with exact flags (lines 92-109)
- [x] Starter template version is current and specified - **N/A:** Uses prototype structure
- [✗] Command search term provided for verification - **FAIL:** No search term for prototype cloning

**Evidence:**
- Lines 88-90: "EAF v1.0 reuses validated prototype structure from `/Users/michael/acci_eaf` rather than using standard starter templates"
- Lines 92-109: Git clone command provided, but not a standard CLI starter

**Gap:** Section does not explicitly call out "Prototype Structure" as the starter template decision or mark decisions as "PROVIDED BY PROTOTYPE"

### ✗ Starter-Provided Decisions

- [✗] Decisions provided by starter marked as "PROVIDED BY STARTER" - **FAIL:** No such markings found
- [x] List of what starter provides is complete (lines 111-155)
- [x] Remaining decisions (not covered by starter) clearly identified
- [x] No duplicate decisions that starter already makes

**Evidence:**

**Evidence:**
- No dedicated "Novel Pattern Design" section found
- **However:** Document contains novel patterns embedded in other sections:

  - **Axon-Flowable Bridge** (Lines 813-832, 1091-1150): Novel bidirectional integration pattern
  - **10-Layer JWT Validation** (Lines 786-812, 2593-2672): Novel comprehensive security validation

## Detailed Findings

### ✗ FAILED ITEMS (13)

#### Section 1: Decision Completeness (3 failures)

**ITEM 1.3:** No placeholder text like "TBD", "[choose]", or "{TODO}" remains
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL
**Evidence:** 3 occurrences of "TBD" found (lines 183, 207, 919) - all for React-Admin version
**Impact:** HIGH - Frontend framework version unspecified blocks Epic 7
**Recommendation:** Specify React-Admin version (latest stable: likely v4.x or v5.x)

**ITEM 1.4:** Optional decisions either resolved or explicitly deferred with rationale
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL
**Evidence:** Some deferred (i18n, Grafana, Feature Flags) but rationale sometimes brief
**Impact:** LOW - Deferrals are documented in Decision Summary
**Recommendation:** No action needed - acceptable level of detail

**ITEM 2.2:** Version numbers are current (verified via WebSearch)
**Status:** ✗ FAIL
**Evidence:**
- Spring Modulith 1.4.3 is **OUTDATED** (current: 1.4.4, released Oct 27, 2025)
- Axon Framework 4.12.1 verification **INCONCLUSIVE** (confirmed: 4.11.0, Feb 2025)
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Outdated versions may have security/bug fixes
**Recommendation:**
1. Update Spring Modulith to 1.4.4 immediately
2. Verify Axon Framework 4.12.1 release status or revert to confirmed 4.11.0

#### Section 2: Version Specificity (1 failure)

**ITEM 2.1:** Every technology choice includes a specific version number
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL
**Evidence:** React-Admin version marked "TBD" (3 occurrences)
**Impact:** HIGH - Blocks Epic 7 implementation
**Recommendation:** Research and specify React-Admin version

#### Section 3: Starter Template Integration (7 failures)

**ITEM 3.1:** Starter template chosen OR "from scratch" decision documented
**Status:** ⚠ PARTIAL
**Evidence:** Prototype reuse documented but not explicitly called "starter alternative"
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Ambiguous for AI agents unfamiliar with prototype approach
**Recommendation:** Add explicit statement: "Prototype structure serves as custom starter template"

**ITEM 3.4:** Command search term provided for verification
**Status:** ✗ FAIL
**Evidence:** No search term for prototype cloning command
**Impact:** LOW - Git clone command is standard
**Recommendation:** Add: "Search term: 'EAF v1.0 prototype structure'"

**ITEM 3.5-3.8:** Starter-Provided Decisions
**Status:** ✗ FAIL (4 items)
**Evidence:** No "PROVIDED BY PROTOTYPE" tags in Decision Summary table
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Agents may duplicate configuration already in prototype
**Recommendation:** Add column "Source" with values: "Prototype", "Analysis (NEW)", "Product Brief", etc.
**NOTE:** Document DOES have "Source" column but not "PROVIDED BY STARTER" marker

#### Section 4: Novel Pattern Design (2 failures - N/A assessment)

**ITEM 4.1-4.9:** All Novel Pattern items
**Status:** N/A (patterns exist but not structured per checklist)
**Evidence:** Multi-tenancy, Axon-Flowable bridge, 10-layer JWT are novel but embedded in other sections
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Patterns ARE documented but not easily discoverable as "novel"
**Recommendation:** Optional - Add "Novel Pattern Design" section cross-referencing:
- Section 16: 3-Layer Multi-Tenancy (lines 2674-2748)
- Section 8: Axon-Flowable Bridge (lines 1091-1150)
- Section 16: 10-Layer JWT Validation (lines 2593-2672)

   - Add explicit statement: "Prototype structure serves as custom starter template"

3. **OPTIONAL (Nice-to-Have):**
   - Add "Novel Pattern Design" section cross-referencing multi-tenancy, Axon-Flowable, JWT validation
   - Re-run version verification quarterly (align with Keycloak ppc64le rebuild schedule)

---

## Next Steps

**Recommended:** Run the **solutioning-gate-check** workflow to validate alignment between PRD, Architecture, and Stories before beginning implementation.

**Timeline:**
- Fix critical version issues: **2-4 hours**
- Address medium-priority gaps: **4-8 hours**
