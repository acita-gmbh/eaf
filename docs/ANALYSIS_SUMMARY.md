# EAF Old Repository - Quick Summary

## What You'll Find in `/Users/michael/eaf_lessons_learned.md`

A comprehensive 29KB analysis covering:

1. **Executive Summary**: Why the project failed (over-planning + loss of MVP focus)
2. **What Went Wrong** (5 core issues):
   - Planning trap: 49 stories + 170 QA docs = false confidence
   - Architectural decisions created expanding scope
   - Loss of focus on MVP (no validation until week 8)
   - High-risk patterns acknowledged but not resolved
   - Technology choices were sound, but scope overwhelming

3. **Timeline Analysis**: Where velocity collapsed
   - Week 1-2: Good progress (4-8 stories/week)
   - Week 3-4: Quality declining, issues appearing
   - Week 5-6: Multiple blockers, MVP stalled
   - Result: 49 stories attempted, ~30-35 net progress

4. **Specific Examples**:
   - Story 7.4a/7.4b: 91KB handoff doc for work that never shipped
   - Story 8.3: Discovered jOOQ migration violation 6 weeks after it should have been caught
   - Story 9.2: Tenant context bug only found during MVP testing

5. **Process Failures**:
   - CONCERNS gates (70/100) approved as "proceed anyway"
   - No dependency management between stories
   - Integration testing was unit-test centric

6. **Key Lessons** (7 actionable items):
   - MVP definition must come first, not last
   - Limit planning to 2-week stories only (4KB docs max)
   - Integration tests first, unit tests second
   - Every merge must validate full MVP
   - No deferred architectural decisions
   - Risk acceptance needs owner + deadline
   - Scope creep must be explicit

7. **Recommendations for New Project**:
   - Keep: Architecture style, tech stack, quality mindset, documentation standards
   - Change: Story size, documentation volume, risk management, testing strategy
   - Success metric: Working MVP by week 3 (not week 8)

## Key Insight: "Verzettelt" Diagnosis Confirmed

The user's concern about "getting lost in details" is exactly what happened:

| Metric | Old Project | Issue |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Stories | 49 | Too many to track |
| QA Assessment Docs | 170+ | False sense of control |
| Story Doc Size | 25-90KB | Should be 4KB max |
| Risk Scores | Acknowledged | But no accountability |
| MVP Validation | Week 8 | Should be week 3 |
| Integration Issues | 5+ found in week 8 | Should be caught in week 2 |

**Root Cause**: Documentation became a substitute for working code.

## How to Use This Analysis

1. **Read the full report** (29KB, ~30 minutes): Gets all the details and context
2. **Skim the sections** you care about most (planning, testing, scope management)
3. **Reference the specific examples** when making trade-offs (e.g., "Remember Story 8.3...")
4. **Use the recommendations** as a checklist for the new project structure

## Files Analyzed

**Old Repository** (`/Users/michael/acci_eaf`):
- 49 story files (~1,400 KB)
- 170+ QA assessment files
- 15+ architecture specification docs
- Git history showing 6 weeks of work

**Key Stories Reviewed**:
- Story 1.1, 2.3, 3.3, 4.3-4.4, 7.4a-7.4b
- Story 8.2, 8.3, 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
- Multiple risk assessments and gate reviews

**Key Findings** (confirmed through multiple sources):
- Cascading integration issues only surfaced in week 8
- High-risk items (score 6) approved with "CONCERNS" but no accountability
- Architectural violations (JPA vs jOOQ) discovered 6 weeks after decision
- MVP validation blocked by foundation issues that should have been caught weeks earlier

## Next Steps for Fresh Start

The new repository (`/Users/michael/eaf`) should:

1. Start with ultra-narrow MVP scope (1 aggregate, 1 end-to-end flow)
2. Deliver working MVP by week 3, not week 8
3. Validate MVP weekly, not at the end
4. Limit stories to 2-week size (4KB docs)
5. Enforce integration testing before merge
6. Make CONCERNS gates actionable (owner + deadline)
7. No deferred architectural decisions

See **Part 6** of the full report for detailed recommendations.
