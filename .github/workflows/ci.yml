# CI Pipeline - DVMM/EAF Monorepo
# Quality Gates: Coverage ≥80%, Mutation ≥70%, Architecture tests pass
# See: docs/devops-strategy.md, CLAUDE.md
#
# NOTE: Mutation testing (Pitest + Arcmutate) requires a commercial license.
# For security reasons, GitHub does not expose secrets to fork PRs.
# Fork PRs will skip mutation testing but maintainers will run the full
# quality gates before merging. This is documented behavior.
